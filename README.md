# TASRecorder
The TASRecorder Mod is an addition to the TASTickratechanger by <a href="https://github.com/ScribbleLP/TASTickratechanger">@ScribbleLP</a>.
It records in 30 fps depending on your Tickrate and then speeds it up without the use of an Video Editing software.

It currently only supports 30 fps recordings and can slow down the game a bit when using shaders (or being on a low end pc).
I will add support for 60 fps and sound somewhen later

<h3>This requires FFMpeg</h3>
You have to put <a href="https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases">ffmpeg gpl</a> to your Documents Folder
